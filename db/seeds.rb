Post and Hutton later built an even larger yacht, Hussar II, which was designed by Cox & Stevens and built by Friedrich Krupp in Kiel, Germany. Launched in 1931, it had panelled saloons and seven lavish cabins. When the couple divorced Marjorie kept the yacht and renamed her Sea Cloud. She served as a patrol vessel for the US Coast Guard during World War II and in 1955 was sold to the Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo, who renamed her Angelita. After his overthrow, she was acquired by Clifford Barbour, who renamed her Antarna. New German owners rescued her from neglect in 1978, returned her name to Sea Cloud, and rebuilt her in Bremerhaven. The yacht now charters in the West Indies during winter and in the Mediterranean in summer, operating with 60 crew and offering 34 cabins. She is featured in volume 3 of The Superyachts book.")

The 2,396 square metre sails are stored within the mast and set by extending outwards along the yards using automated controls. The steel hull was originally built by Perini Navi in Tuzla, Turkey, but the project was cancelled. Following its purchase by Perkins, the underwater lines and appendages were modified by Gerard Dijkstra to maximise sailing performance. The yacht has topped 24 knots under sail.

This has been achieved by developing a full-bodied hull form with generous beam, high ballast ratio and a pivoting centreboard to take the draft to 10 metres when fully deployed. This high aspect ratio foil gives efficient upwind performance while the combination of generous beam and high ballast ratio gives excellent stability.")

Vorontsov, built at the Balk Shipyard in Holland. The story of this intriguing yacht has its roots back in 2007, and has involved people from no less than 10 countries. Her hull was constructed in wood at the DSV yard in Turkey, before being transported by barge some 3,000 miles to the Balk yard for fitting out. DSV brought in Dykstra & Partners to refine the hull, which has been formulated to provide maximum space inside while still turning in good sailing performance, and Ken Freivokh joined the project shortly after to work up the GA and interior design. The result is a classically styled theme with a finish that is second to none \u2013 you only have to look at the intricate carving on the transom of the yacht to see the level of detail that has been indulged throughout. \u2018The basic hull was already there when we got involved,\u2019 says Gerry Dykstra. \u2018The sailing characteristics are quite similar to traditional classic sailing yachts, which also means she is a very seaworthy boat \u2013 the sea-keeping characteristics in a gale is very, very good.\u2019 From her beautifully sculpted and finished deckhouses to her sumptuous wood and cream interior, she will turn heads wherever she sails. The layout will mean that those lucky enough to sail her should enjoy every comfort. Aft is an owner\u2019s suite, including sauna and office, with its own deckhouse. The guest suites follow forward, with steps leading into the main deck saloon \u2013 a large space with bar, television and seating that leads out to a protected guest cockpit.")
